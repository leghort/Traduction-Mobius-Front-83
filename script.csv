,C351Post_000010,After all that shit…
Thomas Grail (Final),C351Post_000020,I just wanna know why we have to be disinfected every time we patrol the perimeter.
David Guerrero (Final),C351Post_000030,They don’t know if being close exposes us to something…

President Reagan,Credits_000000,My fellow Americans:
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000010,Several weeks ago we were taken by surprise by the appearance of several “dark zones” in the central regions of the United States.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000020,"Investigating these regions, we encountered an unknown military force that bore a striking resemblance to our own."
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000030,"These forces were actively hostile, and immediately captured large portions of land inside Illinois and Wisconsin."
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000040,"After the eruption of violence, we were able to establish diplomatic channels with representatives of these people,"
,Credits_000045,which initial reports erroneously described as originating from the Soviet Union.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000050,"They are not Soviet, or even Russian, but make no mistake:"
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000060,"Though these forces claimed to be from a world similar to our own, they are assuredly not Americans."
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000070,"Though they initially claimed their world was dying due to a changing orbit,"
,Credits_000075,we soon learned the real reason behind their aggressive and unfounded action.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000080,They attacked us because their world was ravaged by a type of organism so aggressive and virulent...
,Credits_000090,"that it must never be allowed on American soil. Not now, and not ever."
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000100,"After recognizing the grave threat that this alien organism posed to our Nation,"
,Credits_000105,the Joint Chiefs of Staff and I worked to create a plan to protect the country from this new and heretofore unknown danger.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000110,We had little time and knew that complete secrecy was vital...
,Credits_000115,to ensure both the safety of the young men who would undertake this mission and the Americans they were about to protect.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000120,"One week ago today, at thirty-five minutes past seven, Central Time,"
,Credits_000125,a large contingent of US military forces entered the dark zones and crossed the quantum gates located inside.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000130,Our troops fought hard to establish a foothold in this strange and unforgiving land.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000140,"A few days later, engineers from the 1st Army Corps of Engineers placed nuclear charges near the gate generators..."
,Credits_000145,"and destroyed them irrevocably, sealing that worlds’ fate— and, sadly, their own."
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000150,"I believe those engineers and all those who supported their mission, living and dead, "
,Credits_000155,have lived up to the very best ideals of what it means to be American.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000160,"Now we must remain vigilant. In addition to patrols along the perimeter of the former dark zones,"
,Credits_000170,we also have begun an urgent research and development effort to understand exactly what happened and why.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000180,"There is no guarantee a similar event couldn’t happen in the future, and, as Vice President Bush has so astutely noted,"
,Credits_000185,no guarantee that there aren’t thousands of even millions of other worlds out there looking toward ours as a target for conquest.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000190,"I will not ask you to pray for the dead, because they’re safe in God's loving arms and beyond need of our prayers."
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000200,"I would like to ask you all, wherever you may be in this blessed land, to pray for the young men wounded in this action,"
,Credits_000205,and to pray for the bereaved families of those who gave their lives to protect this great Nation.
Delay,,0.5
,Credits_000210,"God bless you, and God bless America."
